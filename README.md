# Visual Studio C# Code Snippets
This is a collection of the C# code snippets I use in Visual Studio for C# coding. If you're unfamiliar with using code snippets in Visual Studio, refer to this document for more information https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets

The snippets are grouped into the directories in this repository based on what they perform.



| Directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/expression-bodied-properties` | Snippets for quickly creating expression bodied properties. There is a snippet for each data type and a generic one. |
| `/fields` | Snippets for quickly creating fields.  There is a snippet for each data type and a generic one. |
| `/full-properties` | Snippets for quickly creating public properties with a private backing field. There is a snippet for each data type and a generic one. |

# Installation
In order to use these code snippets, you first need to download them. The easiest way is to just clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/manbeardgames/csharp-code-snippets.git
```

Next, locate and open the code snippet directory for the version of visual studio you are using.  

| Version | Location |

| Visual Studio 2017 | `%userprofile%\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets\` |
| Visual Studio 2019 | `%userprofile%\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets\` |

Then just copy the snippet you would like to use from the repo to the *My Code Snippets* directory.
